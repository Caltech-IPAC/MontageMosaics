Jupyter Notebooks for Building Astronomical Mosaics 
===================================================

These Jupyter notebooks use Montage and the MontagePy Python package to build astronomical mosaics.  We plan an extensive set of tutorials, starting with basic mosaicking of data from various astronomical archives.

The simplest way to use these notebooks is to install the Montage package ('pip install MontagePy'), clone the GitHub repo (https://github.com/Caltech-IPAC/MontageMosaics) to your local machine, and open run 'jupyter notebook' in that directory.  Start with the Overview.ipynb notebook, which is really just in introduction to the other pages (of which at the moment there are just two).

-------------------------------------------------------------

Montage  is an Open Source (BSD 3-clause license) toolkit for creating science grade mosaics of astronomical images, and for general astronomical image processing.  Montage can be used as a Linux library, command-line applications on Linux and Windows platforrms, and through Python.

We provide a Jupyter notebook that uses  the Python library to  create and visualize image mosaics according to user specification of location, size and image dateset. The datasets supported are: 2MASS, WISE, SDSS, DSS, Spitzer IRAC and Spitzer MIPS.
