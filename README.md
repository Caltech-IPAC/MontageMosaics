Montage Mosaics:  A Set of Jupyter Notebooks that use Montage to build Astronomical Mosaics
===========================================================================================

Montage is an Open Source toolkit for reprojecting and mosaicking science grade astronomical
images.  It can be used as a LINUX library, command-line applications on LINUX and Windows
and through Python.

Using the Python library, we are constructing a set of Jupyter notebooks that simplify and
illustrate the process of working with astronomical archive or local datasets to build 
region mosaics and full-color renderings of multiple wavelengths.
