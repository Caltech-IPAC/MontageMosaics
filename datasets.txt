            Montage can make mosaics from your own data or from a select set of archives.
            This page is concerned with using archive data and the following archives/bands 
            are available:

             SDSS u (3543 Angstrom)      2MASS J (1.235 microns)    WISE W1 (3.4 microns)
             SDSS g (4770 Angstrom)      2MASS H (1.662 microns)    WISE W2 (4.6 microns)
             SDSS r (6231 Angstrom)      2MASS K (2.159 microns)    WISE W3 (12  microns)
             SDSS i (7625 Angstrom)                                 WISE W4 (22  microns)
             SDSS z (9134 Angstrom)                                

               0.4 arcsec                      1 arcsec            6 arcsec (W4 12 arcsec)    


             These archive are uniform and cover all or most of the sky.  The service can
             also access the DSS plates and the Spitzer data from IRAC and MIPS.  See
